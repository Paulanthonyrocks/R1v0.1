## Core Features

The Traffic Management Hub offers a range of features to address the needs of traffic management professionals:

*   **3D Globe Visualization:** The core of the application, providing a dynamic 3D view of the traffic environment.
*   **Real-time Traffic Data:** Display traffic flow, speed, and volume directly on the 3D globe.
*   **Signal Management:** Enables operators to remotely control and adjust traffic signal timings.
*   **Incident Management:** Allows operators to log and track incidents, manage responses, and view incidents on the map.
*   **System Configuration:** Provides system administrators with the ability to configure various settings, including traffic signal parameters, incident response protocols, and user access.
*   **Dashboard:** Presents an overview of system health, key metrics, and real-time alerts.
*   **User Management:** Enables system administrators to manage user accounts, access levels, and roles.
* **Role-Based Access Control:** Provides control over the information that different user types can view and change.
*   **Alerts and Notifications:** Delivers real-time alerts and notifications to operators regarding critical incidents and system events.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Node.js (version 16 or later)
    *   npm or yarn
    *   Firebase project set up (Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Functions enabled)
2.  **Installation:**
```
bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd traffic-management-hub
    npm install
    
```
3.  **Firebase Configuration:**
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the project root.
    *   Add the following environment variables (replace with your Firebase project's configuration):
```
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
        NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
        
```
4.  **Running the Application:**
```
bash
