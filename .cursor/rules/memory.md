# Development Journal: Traffic Management Hub

## Initial Entry - Project Setup and Data Ingestion Module - Placeholder Development (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Summary:**

Initiated development of the Traffic Management Hub. Reviewed the `implementation_plan.md` to understand project goals and immediate next steps. Focused on the **Data Ingestion Module**.

**Key Activities:**

*   Reviewed the tasks for the Data Ingestion Module:
    *   Identify and integrate with data sources.
    *   Set up data ingestion pipelines (using Kafka).
    *   Implement data validation and preprocessing.
*   Discussed data sources and decided to use placeholders for now (live camera streams, saved recordings, CCTV).
*   Planned to set up a local Kafka instance using Docker for development.
*   Created a `docker-compose.yml` file to define Kafka and Zookeeper services.
*   Attempted to run `docker-compose up -d` but encountered system-level `sudo` errors and a non-running Docker daemon, preventing the local Kafka setup at this time.
*   Decided to proceed with developing the Kafka producer and consumer scripts using placeholder configurations while the Docker issue is resolved.
*   Added the `kafka-python` library to the `.idx/dev.nix` file to enable Kafka interaction in the Python environment.
*   Created `backend/data_ingestion/data_producer.py`: A Python script simulating data generation and sending to a placeholder Kafka topic (`raw_traffic_data`).
*   Created `backend/data_ingestion/data_consumer.py`: A Python script simulating consuming data from the placeholder Kafka topic (`raw_traffic_data`).

**Next Steps:**

*   Address the system-level `sudo` and Docker daemon issues to get the local Kafka instance running.
*   Once Kafka is running, test the producer and consumer scripts.
*   Refine the producer and consumer scripts to handle more realistic data formats and processing logic.
*   Move on to other tasks in the Data Ingestion Module or other modules as prioritized.

**Open Questions/Challenges:**

*   Resolving the `sudo` and Docker daemon issues.
*   Determining the specific data formats from future data sources.
*   How to handle potential inconsistencies or errors in ingested data.

## Update - Data Ingestion Pipeline V1 Operational - (2025-05-27)

**Summary:**

Significant progress has been made on the **Data Ingestion Module**. The pipeline, from data production through Kafka to storage in MongoDB, is now operational and includes data validation and initial processing logic. The previous Docker and Kafka setup issues appear to be resolved.

**Key Activities:**

*   **Kafka and MongoDB Integration:**
    *   The system now successfully uses Kafka for message queuing (`raw_traffic_data` topic).
    *   `data_consumer.py` consumes messages from Kafka.
    *   Processed data is stored in a MongoDB database (`traffic_db_improved`, `processed_traffic_data` collection).
*   **Data Processing and Validation in Consumer:**
    *   `data_consumer.py` has been substantially developed beyond a simple placeholder.
    *   It uses Pydantic models (`RawTrafficDataInputModel`, `ProcessedTrafficDataDBModel`) for input validation and data structuring.
    *   It calculates a `congestion_score` based on incoming vehicle count and average speed.
    *   It appears to include logic for regional data aggregation (`RegionalAggregatedTrafficDBModel`, `windowed_data_store`), though the specifics of this are yet to be fully detailed.
*   **Pipeline Health Check:**
    *   A new script, `backend/data_ingestion/check_ingestion_pipeline.py`, was created.
    *   This script performs end-to-end checks:
        *   Verifies Kafka topic existence.
        *   Produces test messages (both valid and malformed) to Kafka.
        *   Checks MongoDB to ensure valid data is stored and malformed data is rejected.
        *   Includes a basic check to see if the `data_consumer.py` process is running.
*   **Configuration and Models:**
    *   Configuration for Kafka and MongoDB connections, topics, and database/collection names is managed (likely via `backend/data_ingestion/config.py`).
    *   Data models are defined in `backend/data_ingestion/models.py`.
*   **Error Handling (Initial):**
    *   `data_consumer.py` includes placeholder logic for a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for messages that fail processing.
    *   Database operations in `data_consumer.py` include retry mechanisms.

**Next Steps:**

*   Fully implement and test the regional data aggregation logic in `data_consumer.py`.
*   Develop robust error handling, including the implementation of the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) functionality.
*   Refine data validation rules and ensure comprehensive logging.
*   Begin development of other core modules as per the `implementation_plan.md`, such as the Pavement Analysis module or the Traffic Anomaly Detection module.
*   Expand the `check_ingestion_pipeline.py` script to cover more test cases and provide more detailed diagnostics.

**Open Questions/Challenges:**

*   Scalability of the current in-memory windowed data store for aggregation in `data_consumer.py`.
*   Detailed schema and processing requirements for other anticipated data sources.
*   Integration strategy for the outputs of this ingestion pipeline with other backend services/modules.
