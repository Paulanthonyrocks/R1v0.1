# Development Journal: Traffic Management Hub

## Initial Entry - Project Setup and Data Ingestion Module - Placeholder Development (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Summary:**

Initiated development of the Traffic Management Hub. Reviewed the `implementation_plan.md` to understand project goals and immediate next steps. Focused on the **Data Ingestion Module**.

**Key Activities:**

*   Reviewed the tasks for the Data Ingestion Module:
    *   Identify and integrate with data sources.
    *   Set up data ingestion pipelines (using Kafka).
    *   Implement data validation and preprocessing.
*   Discussed data sources and decided to use placeholders for now (live camera streams, saved recordings, CCTV).
*   Planned to set up a local Kafka instance using Docker for development.
*   Created a `docker-compose.yml` file to define Kafka and Zookeeper services.
*   Attempted to run `docker-compose up -d` but encountered system-level `sudo` errors and a non-running Docker daemon, preventing the local Kafka setup at this time.
*   Decided to proceed with developing the Kafka producer and consumer scripts using placeholder configurations while the Docker issue is resolved.
*   Added the `kafka-python` library to the `.idx/dev.nix` file to enable Kafka interaction in the Python environment.
*   Created `backend/data_ingestion/data_producer.py`: A Python script simulating data generation and sending to a placeholder Kafka topic (`raw_traffic_data`).
*   Created `backend/data_ingestion/data_consumer.py`: A Python script simulating consuming data from the placeholder Kafka topic (`raw_traffic_data`).

**Next Steps:**

*   Address the system-level `sudo` and Docker daemon issues to get the local Kafka instance running.
*   Once Kafka is running, test the producer and consumer scripts.
*   Refine the producer and consumer scripts to handle more realistic data formats and processing logic.
*   Move on to other tasks in the Data Ingestion Module or other modules as prioritized.

**Open Questions/Challenges:**

*   Resolving the `sudo` and Docker daemon issues.
*   Determining the specific data formats from future data sources.
*   How to handle potential inconsistencies or errors in ingested data.
