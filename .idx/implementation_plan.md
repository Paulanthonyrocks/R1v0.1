# Traffic Management Hub Implementation Plan

## Project Overview

The Traffic Management Hub aims to provide a centralized system for monitoring, analyzing, and managing traffic flow in a designated area. The initial phase will focus on ingesting real-time traffic data, providing basic visualization, and offering initial tools for managing traffic signals.

**Goals:**

*   Ingest real-time traffic data from various sources.
*   Visualize traffic conditions on an interactive map.
*   Provide a user interface for controlling traffic signals.
*   Lay the foundation for future features like predictive analysis and route optimization.

## Immediate Next Steps & Key Features

### 1. Data Ingestion Module

**Overview:** Establish the pipeline for receiving and processing real-time traffic data.

**Tasks:**

*   Design and implement data ingestion API/service endpoints.
    *   Define initial API contract (e.g., `POST /api/v1/traffic-data` with expected JSON payload schema: `{ timestamp: string, sensor_id: string, location: { lat: number, lon: number }, speed?: number, occupancy?: number, vehicle_count?: number }`).
    *   Consider different endpoint structures for various data source types if necessary.
*   Integrate with initial data sources (e.g., simulated data, existing sensors - TBD).
*   Implement data validation and basic processing logic.
*   Store raw and processed data in a time-series database.
    *   Define initial schema for raw traffic data (e.g., fields: `timestamp`, `sensor_id`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `speed`, `vehicle_count`).
    *   Define initial schema for processed data (e.g., aggregated congestion levels per road segment, fields: `segment_id`, `timestamp`, `congestion_level`).

**Technologies:**

*   Backend Framework (e.g., Python/FastAPI, Node.js/Express)
*   Messaging Queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ)
*   Time-Series Database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB)
*   Data Formats (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers)

### 2. Real-time Visualization

**Overview:** Develop the frontend to display traffic data on an interactive map.

**Tasks:**

*   **Dependency:** This module is dependent on the **Data Ingestion Module** to be functional to provide the necessary data.

*   Choose a map library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS).
*   Implement map initialization and basemap integration.
*   Develop logic to fetch and display real-time traffic data overlays (e.g., congestion levels, incident markers).
*   Implement basic zooming and panning functionality.

**Technologies:**

*   Frontend Framework (e.g., React, Vue.js, Angular)
*   Map Library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox GL JS)
*   Data Visualization Library (optional, e.g., D3.js)
*   WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

### 3. Traffic Signal Control Interface (Basic)

**Overview:** Create a user interface for basic control of connected traffic signals.

**Tasks:**

*   Design a simple interface to list available traffic signals.
*   Implement functionality to change signal phases (e.g., red, yellow, green) for a selected signal.
*   Integrate with a dummy or simulated traffic signal API/service.
    *   Define dummy signal API: e.g., `GET /signals` (list signals), `POST /signals/{id}/set_phase` (body: `{ phase: 'green' | 'yellow' | 'red' }`).
*   Add basic status display for each signal.
    *   Define basic signal status schema: e.g., `{ id: string, current_phase: 'green' | 'yellow' | 'red', last_updated: string }`.


**Technologies:**

*   Frontend Framework (same as Visualization)
*   Backend API to interact with signal control system (initial dummy implementation)
*   Security considerations for control commands (future phase)

## Future Features (Beyond Immediate Steps)

### User Authentication and Authorization

**Overview:** Implement a secure system for user login and managing user roles/permissions. This is crucial for controlling access to sensitive features like traffic signal control.

**Tasks:**

*   Set up a user authentication service (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Auth0, or a custom solution).
*   Implement user registration and login flows.
*   Define user roles (e.g., admin, operator, viewer).
*   Implement authorization checks to restrict access to specific features based on user roles.
*   Secure API endpoints to require authentication and authorization.

**Technologies:**

### Real-time Traffic Data Display

**Overview:** Enhance the real-time visualization module from the immediate steps to display more detailed and dynamic traffic information on the map, potentially including advanced overlays and data types.

**Tasks:**

*   Develop components to display various types of traffic data overlays (e.g., traffic flow lines with color coding, incident markers with tooltips, live camera feeds - future).

*   Advanced Analytics and Reporting
*   Predictive Traffic Modeling
*   Route Optimization Engine
*   Integration with more diverse data sources
*   Mobile Application Development
